      "description": "Bronk was born in Fort Edward, near Hudson Falls, New York where he lived his entire life except for his student years at Dartmouth College and Harvard University, a period of military service during World War II and a brief stint as an instructor at Union College. Even after he gained a wide readership, Bronk shrank from public attention and concentrated on his immediate surroundings. His writing xpresses his refusal to compromise his life style and point of view as in his poem The Abnegation (1971): I will not / be less than I am to be more human. He believes that what he knows of the world is only a semblance of the truth at best. Reality exists and he is able to intuit its existence, but it is finally beyond his grasp. Despite Bronk’s asceticism, he was constantly sought out by readers and many poets who would journey to Hudson Falls to visit; for young poets, this trip was something of a rite of passage. Bronk won some major poetry awards, the American Book Award in 1982 and the Lannan Prize for his life’s work ten years later. When at Dartmouth, he met Frost, and his fellow student and friend was Samuel French Morse, who became a well known authority on Stevens. Bronks first publishing successes were due to the efforts of Cid CORMAN who printed Bronks work in Origin, the magazine he edited, and who published Bronk’s first book Light and Dark, in 1956. Bronk also enjoyed the support of Creeley in his magazine the Black Mountain Review, in the 1950s, and Bronk’s second book, The World, the Worldless, was published by New Directions in 1964 with the help of Oppen and his sister June Oppen Degnan, who was an editor at the press.",
      "conclusion": "Bronks poem Some Musicians Play Chamber Music for Us (1955), in a phrase reminiscent of Stevens, claims that all we will know are fragments of a world, even through the arts. In The Minds Landscape on an Early Winter Day(1955), a poem whose evocation of winter rivals winter poems by Frost, Bronk writes, with an unparalleled bleakness that in turn evokes a delicate beauty, of what he calls the winter mind, the ne’er do well, his alter ego, a poor blindthat is always lost and gropes its way […] even when the senses seize the world.The best comfort against the sense of being lost are the stories we live and the metaphors we are. Thus Brons poem The Wanted Exactitude (1991) ends in a single-line stanza: let our metaphor be accurate. Metaphor is as close to reality as he can come. In The Minds Limitations Are Its Freedom (1972) Bronk asks, What else but the mind / senses the final uselessness of the mind The irony in this statement is not, of course, lost on Bronk, and so it might be a surprise to realize that his contemplation of the human mind is joyful even though the mind of man is frail, deep / in disorder and always pushed by the falsenesses / of unreality.It is this unreality that is predicated by desire, and so Bronk has no choice but to embrace that desire. I want to be that Tantalus, Bronk proclaims in The Abnegation, unfed forever. He asks that he be spared all compassion and that his reader notice how humankind takes handouts, makeshifts, sops for creature comfort. These he refuses"
